<strong>Note: it is not recommended to use the WordPress automatic plugin upgrade on this plugin. Instead, download and extract the plugin manually from the plugin page at http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/peters-custom-anti-spam-image</strong>

Stop a lot of spambots from polluting your site by making visitors identify a random word displayed as an image before commenting and optionally before registering. You can customize the pool of words to display. The comment form protection in this plugin is compatible with WordPress and WordPress MU. Default registration form protection is only compatible with normal WordPress. For WordPress MU, see here: http://www.theblog.ca/anti-spam-mu

== Installation ==

Unzip all files to the folder custom-anti-spam in your plugins directory, so that the path is wp-content/plugins/custom-anti-spam/. Then activate the plugin via your WordPress admin section. The plugin should work directly "out of the box", but all settings can be customized in the Settings > Custom anti-spam page in your WordPress control panel. If you are upgrading from a previous release, de-activate that release first.
